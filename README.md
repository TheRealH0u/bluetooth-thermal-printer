# Bluetooth Thermal Printer
I reverse a bluetooth thermal printer and found other github repositories that did that and made a simple and scuffed python library to import.

The dithering library was used from here https://github.com/Utkarsh-Deshmukh/image-dithering-python?tab=readme-ov-file because the images are printed out nicer

## Usage
Look at test.py there are all the functions that you can use. If I forgot any you can look at the BLESPPUtils library.
